# Meteor

## Description
Meteor is an imperative programming language intended for systems programming and embedded systems that require reliable performance and efficient and safe memory management. Meteor's strong type system and Rust-like ownership model guarantee memory safety by raising compiler errors when dangling or use-after-free pointers are found in your code, which provides the programmer with low level control without the need to sacrifice high level conveniences. 

To compile the compiler: make all
To compile a meteor program: ./compiler.native <name_of_the_program>
To run the compile program: ./a.out
